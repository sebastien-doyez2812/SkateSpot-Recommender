The model seems to learn but is enable to generalize on the data.
The data is too noisy due to input that are not revelant for the prediction ( grade of skatepark)

The best approch is to give as an input :
- the Weather
- traffic time
- current distance
- the id of the skatepark (that will be hardcoded, and a new skatepark means that we need to finetune)
